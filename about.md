## Goals and structure

The WG is focused on three major areas for 2018, each of which has a dedicated subgroup, pair of leaders, and Discord channel for discussion:

- [Async foundations](/wg-net/async-foundations)
- [Embedded foundations](/wg-net/embedded-foundations)
- [Web foundations](/wg-net/web-foundations)

If you want to get involved in one or more of these efforts, hop on [Discord][discord] and say hello, or take a look at the [issue tracker].
